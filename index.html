<h3>WIP: High-Score Leaderboard from CSV file</h3>
<!--Insert link here-->
<p>This work-in-progress project makes use of file-reading and exception catching to extract data from a CSV of player usernames and their highscores. <br>
The data is placed from a HashMap into binary search tree to rank the players in increasing score order. The breadth-first-search algorithm is used on a graph to find the difference in ranking between two players.</p>
